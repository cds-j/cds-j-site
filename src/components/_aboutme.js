          Art has my life and music has my heart. Exploring both through design, digital/analog 
          technology, and language has been my focus since the mid-2010s. I'm interested in iterating/reiterating 
          new systems for sustainable living, developing independent, self-sufficient black cultural 
          institutions, and funding/contributing to decolonization projects. The improvisational nature of 
          Jazz has influenced the methods in which I approach making. 
        </p>

          Thus far, I've learned front-end web technologies (HTML + CSS + JavaScript + React), industry-standard 
          design software (Adobe Creative Suite + Figma), and DAWs (Ableton Live + ProTools) I'm currently 
          learning p5.js to incorporate creative code into my art/design practice. When I'm not building up my toolkit
          for making things, I play tenor saxophone and trumpet.
