          Corey De&apos;Juan Sherrard Jr (born 1996, Houston, TX) engineers a developing system for composing songs and generating objects that 
          respond to the deficit of black radical propaganda within a world culture. He began producing music in 2013 and, through undergrad, 
          exploring different mediums/materials for design and artmaking. He graduated from the <a href="https://www.uh.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>University of Houston</b></a> with a BS in Digital Media,

          exhibition <i>Songbook for Black Constellations</i> at <a href="https://www.sanman.company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>Sanman Studios</b></a> in 2023 and has since
