              <p>
                <i>Adobe Illustrator</i> • This flier was a quick turnaround because 
                I received valuable in-person feedback and my friend trusted my idea for this.
                The printed takeaway includes art writing from Veronica Carlton and further information
                for this show provided by Lawndale Art Center in Houston, Texas.

                As a music lover, a JAZZ lover, this is the type of work that I enjoy doing. It's even more 
                rewarding to know that I'll be holding it in my hands once it's produced and manufactured.

                Pretty straight-forward but I find that jazz album covers can feel the same way.

              <p>
                <i>Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop</i> • Branding for this campaign was one of the most 
                exciting projects I'd done since I graduated from the University of Houston. I determined the brand colors
                and typography (shown on the website as well) and collaborated on the palm card with campaign volunteers. Finalizing
                this work took a lot of communication, feedback, and execution.
