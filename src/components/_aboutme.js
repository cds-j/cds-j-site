          BS, Digital Media from <b>University of Houston</b><br/>

          Art has my life and music has my heart. Exploring both through design, 
          technology (digital and analog), and language has been my focus since the early 2010s. 
          I believe that the real work lies in solving problems that impede on the livelihood of 
          people all over the world. I'm interested in iterating/reiterating new systems for 
          sustainable living, developing independent, self-sufficient black cultural institutions, 
          and funding/contributing to decolonization projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always looking for ways to expand my skillset and build my experiences. If there are
          any projects you'd like to share with me or collaborate on, feel free to contact me through
          any of the methods available in the footer.
