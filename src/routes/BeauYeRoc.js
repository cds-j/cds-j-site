                        <p> 
                            "international black labor strike" is the B side to "new afrika, 21'", a project that was
                            created in response to the bitter truths about exploitation, one's worth, one's expectations,
                            and being black within a racial-capitalist nation. Recorded through the end of September 2021 into
                            the beginning of that October, the work was a manifestation of escapism through creation
                            and a subconscious outpouring of questions linked to the times.

                        <p>
                            "new afrika, '21" was created within 2 weeks amidst unemployment during the covid-19 pandemic. My political leanings
                            were different and the excitement I once felt about participating in the world as it was had 
                            fled. This tape was a fleeting opportunity to escape from financial insecurity and 
                            the withering of my self esteem, to settle momentarily in a practice I had exercised since 2013.

                        <p>
                            "staff picks (new world anthology)" was arranged from beats and loops left over some years
                            and months on USBs and hard drives. The "staff" was in reference to myself. "new world anthology"
                            was in reference to the possibilities lying ahead through the seizing of our destinies, the
                            power in our intent.

                            "world literature for mutual aid" was initially released as an EP to help
                            fund resources during the winter storm of February 2021. Since then, the project has been
                            updated with several more tracks and will continue to be updated as an ever-growing
                            body of music.

                            "world art, pt. i" was an album mixed from a batch of 100 beats made through 2019, with the 
                            exception of a few beats made between 2016-2018. Laced with audio personally captured in New York City
                            and tags exclaiming "Preservation, Cultivation, Experimentation", "world art, pt. i" embodies
                            black artistry and it's worldliness.
